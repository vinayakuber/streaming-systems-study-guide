/*
 * check_band_honesty.js — a band may not name an artifact it does not have.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   The same block was reported "converted to WHY -> WHEN -> DIAGRAM -> PROGRAM"
 *   twenty times and was still wrong every time. Root cause: check_block_shape.js
 *   is invoked on diagrams/anim/<w>/embed.md — files the GENERATORS write. It
 *   never read content/*.js, which is where flow-section program blocks actually
 *   live and where docs/ is generated from. So the loop was:
 *       generate a new section beside the block -> gate reads the new section
 *       -> PASS -> report "ALL GATES PASS" -> the block is untouched.
 *   A gate aimed at your own output cannot fail. This one is aimed at the source.
 *
 * WHAT IT ENFORCES
 *   A program block whose text contains a `DIAGRAM —` banner claims there is a
 *   diagram. A `PROGRAM —` banner claims there is a runnable program with its
 *   memory shown. Prose under either banner is a label lying about its content:
 *   the reader is told "DIAGRAM" and shown a paragraph. So:
 *     - `DIAGRAM —` banner  => the section must declare a rendered walkthrough
 *                              (diagrams/anim/<name>/, name NOT ending -memory)
 *     - `PROGRAM —` banner  => the section must declare a memory walkthrough
 *                              (name ending -memory: stack + heap per step)
 *   A section that has BOTH a rendered walkthrough AND a `program:` block repeating
 *   the same band as prose is a DUPLICATE — the reader gets two versions of one
 *   concept. The block is the copy and must be deleted.
 *   A band with no artifact yet must be listed in BANDS_PENDING.txt. That keeps
 *   the debt COUNTED and VISIBLE instead of silently passing. A stale entry — one
 *   whose artifact now exists — also fails, so the ledger can only shrink.
